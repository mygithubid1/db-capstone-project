# Database capstone project

Things to note in week 2 exercises:
1. There is no function called ManageBookings() given in the exercise writeup.
1. No information has been provided on which table(s) to join staff information with. So, the table is left as is. Once known, one-to-one or one-to-many join can be performed.
